# vimproved's Portage Overlay
Bringing you Wayland ricing and Yuri Visual Novels since 2023!

## A couple notes on the Visual Novels in this overlay
### Users:
*_PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE_* do not bug game developers about any issues you
experience when using games installed via this overlay. It's very much not the
intended environment to play these games, and is mostly useful for portability
purposes. Thank you!

### Game Developers:
Currently all of the Visual Novels in this overlay are fetch-restricted and
proprietary. However, due to the nature of renpy, pretty much anything made
with it can be patched on a source-level pretty easily. The renpy packaging
in this overlay extracts the renpy archives contained in a game, and installs
the extracted scripts. Additionally, some games contain patches to make them
work with the newest version of renpy, with these patches exposing very small
fragments of the source scripts. If any of the creators of these Visual Novels
are uncomfortable with this, please just create an issue in this repository or
shoot me an email at vimproved@inventati.org and I will remove any packages, no
questions asked.
